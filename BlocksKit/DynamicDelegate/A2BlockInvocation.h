/** An `A2BlockInvocation` is an Objective-C block call rendered static, that
 is, it is an action turned into an object. `A2BlockInvocation` objects are used
 to store and forward closure invocations between objects, primarily by the
 `A2DynamicDelegate` system.

 A block invocation object can be repeatedly dispatched with multiple sets of
 arguments with the same flexibility as NSInvocation. This design makes
 `A2BlockInvocation` extremely useful, because blocks can be used to capture
 scope and a block invocation can be used to save it for later.

 Like `NSInvocation`, `A2BlockInvocation` does not support invocations of
 methods with variadic arguments or union arguments.

/** Returns an `A2BlockInvocation` object able to construct calls to a given
 block using a given method signature.
 
 The method signature given must be compatible with the signature of the block.
 Generally, this means being all the same except for the selector argument, for
 a block is the first parameter of the block's function dispatch just like
 `self` is the first parameter of a method.
 
 An example method returning a string for an integer argument would have the
 following properties:
 - Block type signature of `NSString *(^)(int)`
 - Block function definition of `NSString *(*)(id, int)`
 - Block signature of `"@@?i"`
 - Method signature of `"@:i"` or `"@i"`
 
 @param block An Objective-C block literal
 @param methodSignature An method signature matching the block
 @return An initialized block invocation object
